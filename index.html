    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Green Day is an American punk rock band formed in 1987 in Berkeley, California. Known for their energetic performances and rebellious spirit, they played a major role in popularizing punk rock in the 1990s.

Members:

Billie Joe Armstrong – Lead vocals, guitar

Mike Dirnt – Bass guitar, backing vocals

Tré Cool – Drums, percussion

Story:
The band rose to fame with their 1994 breakthrough album Dookie, which sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. and won a Grammy Award. Their music blends catchy melodies with themes of youthful rebellion, political protest, and emotional honesty. Over the decades, Green Day has released multiple hit albums such as American Idiot, 21st Century Breakdown, and Revolution Radio, earning a loyal fan base worldwide. 
Billie Joe Armstrong (born February 17, 1972, in Oakland, California) is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist best known as the lead vocalist and co-founder of Green Day. Growing up in Rodeo, California, he began playing guitar at a young age and met future bandmate Mike Dirnt in elementary school.

In 1987, the two formed the band that would eventually become Green Day, blending punk energy with pop sensibility. Armstrong’s songwriting, often personal and politically charged, helped define the band’s signature sound. Beyond Green Day, he has worked on side projects like Foxboro Hot Tubs and The Longshot.

Known for his charismatic stage presence and raw lyrics, Armstrong remains one of punk rock’s most influential voices.
Mike Dirnt (born Michael Ryan Pritchard on May 4, 1972, in Berkeley, California) is an American musician best known as the bassist and backing vocalist for Green Day. He met Billie Joe Armstrong in elementary school, and their shared love for music led them to form a band as teenagers.

Known for his fast, melodic bass lines and energetic performances, Dirnt has been a driving force in shaping Green Day’s punk rock sound. His stage name, “Dirnt,” comes from the “dirnt, dirnt, dirnt” noise he made while pretending to play bass as a kid.

Beyond Green Day, Dirnt has participated in side projects and contributed to various charitable causes. His dedication to music and his dynamic presence make him an essential part of the band’s identity.
Tré Cool (born Frank Edwin Wright III on December 9, 1972, in Frankfurt, West Germany) is an American musician best known as the drummer for Green Day. He joined the band in 1990, replacing former drummer John Kiffmeyer, and quickly became known for his explosive drumming style and wild sense of humor.

Raised in California, Tré Cool started playing drums in his early teens and was part of the punk band The Lookouts before joining Green Day. His high-energy performances, creative fills, and onstage antics have made him a fan favorite.

Beyond his drumming skills, he occasionally contributes vocals and songwriting, adding to the band’s diverse sound. His unique personality and musical talent have helped cement Green Day’s place in punk rock history.</p>
